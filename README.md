Automated data pipeline for event-based systems.  

## Overview
- Collects event, entity, and transaction data.
- Cleans and integrates data into a PostgreSQL database.
- Processes historical and real-time data.
- Supports multithreading and automated logging.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Pandas, Requests, JSON
- Threading, ETL, Logging

## Features / Highlights
- ETL pipeline with historical & daily data processing
- Threaded real-time processing of events
- Automated foreign key resolution and bulk DB integration
- Logging, retry mechanisms, error handling


ðŸ”¹ Technical Skills Demonstrated

ETL Automation: End-to-end workflow for structured data pipelines.
APIs & Web Data: Resilient API interactions with retries, logging, and error handling.
Python Engineering: Modular, multi-file project with utilities and shared functions.
Databases: Bulk loading, resolving foreign keys, transaction handling.
Concurrency: Multi-threaded processing of real-time data.
DevOps Practices: Logging, configuration management, and separation of concerns.


ðŸ”¹ Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: APIs occasionally failed or returned incomplete data.
âœ… Solution: Implemented a retry decorator with customizable retries and delays.
Challenge: Large volumes of historical data needed efficient integration.
âœ… Solution: Used bulk inserts and smart date-based batch processing.
Challenge: Different datasets (events, entities, return rates) required synchronization.
âœ… Solution: Created a schema dictionary and resolver functions to keep relationships consistent.
Challenge: Need for real-time feedback and monitoring.
âœ… Solution: Built a Discord bot integration for live alerts and summaries.
